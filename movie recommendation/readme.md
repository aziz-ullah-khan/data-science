# Welcome to my Movie Recommendation Project!
---

In this project, I explore the Movielens dataset and use the Microsoft Recommenders library to build a movie recommendation system based on historical user behavior. The algorithm of choice for this project is SAR (Simple Algorithm for Recommendation), which is known for its ability to provide accurate recommendations for both popular and niche items.

The goal of this project is to build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their past movie preferences. By the end of this project, you will have a working recommendation system that you can use to suggest movies to users.

So, let's dive into the exciting world of movie recommendations!
