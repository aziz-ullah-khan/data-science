Introduction:

This is the CARTOON CLASSIFICATION project, which aims to classify the characters from the popular TV show "The Simpsons" using deep learning. The project utilizes the Kaggle Simpsons Characters Data, a dataset containing images of various characters from the show, to train and test the model.

The project implements the ResNet18 algorithm, a widely used deep learning architecture for image classification tasks, using the Torchvision library in PyTorch. The project's goal is to provide an intuitive and hands-on approach to image classification using deep learning while having some fun with the beloved characters from "The Simpsons."

So, if you're a fan of "The Simpsons" and want to learn about image classification using deep learning, this project is the perfect starting point. Let's dive in!
