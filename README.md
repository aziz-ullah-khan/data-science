## Projects:

Here in this repo you can find notebooks of myt data science and machine learning projects.

* **[Swift Code Information Extractor Using Transformer NER](https://github.com/aziz-ullah-khan/data-science/tree/main/swift%20code%20information%20extraction):**
This project is the like a prototype for understanding Swift code by a layman with a native understandable language. The trained model detect the variable type, variable name, object type, object name etc in Swift code. 

* **[Quora Question Pairs](https://github.com/aziz-ullah-khan/data-science/tree/main/quora%20question%20pairs):**
Sentences or questions similarities is utmost important in many applications and machine learning approaches have applied to solve this problem by many researchers. Questions similarities is very hot topic these days and many researchers are approaching the problem to solve with a reasonable accuracy. 
In this project, we deep dived with different algorithms/experiments to find the optimal solution to the problem along with the comparison of multiple models. The dataset used for this project is obtained from the Kaggle competition with the name “Quora Question Pairs” and is available openly on the website Kaggle.com. In our approach we implemented many classical models like logistic regressions, decision tree. Subsequently we configured BERT transformers with different model type.

* **[Entities Identification in Healthcare Data](https://github.com/aziz-ullah-khan/data-science/tree/main/entities%20identification%20in%20healthcare%20data):**
To derive Name Entity Recognition (NER) on Medical data set so that we can classify the given word as of type Disease, Treatment or Others

* **[Chatbot](https://github.com/aziz-ullah-khan/data-science/tree/main/chatbot):**
Chatbot - Specific for Japanese but can be used for any language with slight tunning!
