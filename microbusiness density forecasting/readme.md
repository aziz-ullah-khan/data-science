# GoDaddy - Microbusiness Density Forecasting
---

This project was completed as part of a forecasting competition to predict the density of microbusinesses in counties across the United States. Microbusinesses are often too small or too new to show up in traditional economic data sources, making this a challenging prediction problem. However, it is believed that microbusiness activity may be correlated with other economic indicators of general interest.

The competition was focused on making static forecasts using historic economic data that was available before the end of the submission period. The forecasting phase public leaderboard and final private leaderboard were determined using data gathered after the submission period closed. Although the submissions were rescored during the forecasting period, no notebooks were re-run. This project involved using various regression models to make predictions and the best performing model was chosen for final submission.
