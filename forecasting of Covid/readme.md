# Forecasting of COVID
---
*Introduction* -
In this project, I utilized the Kaggle COVID-19 dataset and the open-source tool Prophet to build time-series models that could predict the spread of COVID-19 in different countries. My goal was to provide insights and predictions that could help inform public health policies and interventions to curb the spread of the virus.
