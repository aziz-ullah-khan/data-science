# Forecasting of COVID
---
*Introduction* -
In this project, we will utilize the Kaggle COVID-19 dataset and the open-source tool Prophet to build time-series models that can predict the spread of COVID-19 in different countries. Our goal is to provide insights and predictions that can help inform public health policies and interventions to curb the spread of the virus.
