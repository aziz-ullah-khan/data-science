# Hate Speech Detection
---
*Introduction* -
In this project, I performed sentiment analysis on tweets to identify whether the text is hate speech, offensive language, or neutral. I used the Kaggle Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset, which contains a collection of tweets labeled as either hate speech, offensive language, or neutral.

To accomplish this task, I used the Huggingface Transformers library, a popular and powerful library for natural language processing tasks. Specifically, I used the DeBERTa algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for text classification tasks.

By the end of this project, I had developed a working hate speech detection model that could classify tweets into one of three categories: hate speech, offensive language, or neutral.
