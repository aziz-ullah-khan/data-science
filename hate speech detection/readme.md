# Hate Speech Detection
---
*Introduction* -
In this notebook, we performed sentiment analysis on tweets to identify whether the text is hate speech, offensive language, or neutral. We used the Kaggle Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset, which contains a collection of tweets labeled as either hate speech, offensive language, or neutral.

To accomplish this task, we used the Huggingface Transformers library, a popular and powerful library for natural language processing tasks. Specifically, we used the DeBERTa algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for text classification tasks.

By the end of this notebook, we had a working hate speech detection model that could classify tweets into one of three categories: hate speech, offensive language, or neutral.
