# Hate Speech Detection
---
*Introduction* -
Welcome to this notebook on Hate Speech Detection! In today's world where social media platforms are ubiquitous, identifying hateful content and preventing its spread is of utmost importance. In this notebook, we'll be performing sentiment analysis on tweets to identify whether the text is hate speech, offensive language, or neutral. We'll be using the Kaggle Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset, which contains a collection of tweets labeled as either hate speech, offensive language, or neutral.

To accomplish this task, we'll be using the Huggingface Transformers library, a popular and powerful library for natural language processing tasks. Specifically, we'll be using the DeBERTa algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for text classification tasks.

By the end of this notebook, you'll have a working hate speech detection model that can classify tweets into one of three categories: hate speech, offensive language, or neutral. Let's get started!
