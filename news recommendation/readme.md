# News Recommendation
---

Welcome to the News Recommendation repository! In this notebook, we will be exploring news recommendation systems using NLP and recommendation systems. In today's world, with an abundance of news articles available online, it is challenging for users to find the content that is most relevant to their interests. This is where news recommendation systems come in, providing personalized article suggestions to users based on their reading history and preferences.

We will be using the Microsoft MIND dataset and the Microsoft Recommenders library to build a news recommendation system. Specifically, we will be implementing the LSTUR algorithm, which combines natural language processing techniques with recommendation systems to provide a more accurate and personalized experience for users.

By the end of this notebook, you will have a deeper understanding of news recommendation systems and the tools and techniques used to build them. We hope you find this repository informative and useful for your future projects. Let's dive into the world of news recommendation using NLP and recommendation systems!
