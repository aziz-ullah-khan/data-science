---

Welcome to the Celebrity Identification project's Github repository!

This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of Microsoft Cognitive Services' Face API for recognizing and identifying celebrities in images. Our dataset for this project is the Celebrity Face Recognition Dataset, which includes a diverse collection of famous individuals from various fields, such as actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, and more.

By utilizing the Face API, we can accurately detect and identify celebrities in images, making it a valuable tool for a variety of applications, including security systems, social media analytics, and marketing campaigns. Throughout this notebook, we will explore the features and functionality of the Face API, and how to use it to recognize and identify celebrities in images.

We hope that this project provides a useful and informative introduction to the exciting world of Celebrity Identification with the Face API. Thank you for visiting our Github repository, and we look forward to your feedback and contributions!
