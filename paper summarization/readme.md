# Paper Summarization
---

**Introduction**\
Welcome to the Paper Summarization Notebook! This notebook focuses on generating summaries for academic papers using the arXiv Summarization Dataset and the Huggingface Transformers library.

**Motivation**\
Summarizing lengthy academic papers is a tedious task that requires considerable effort and expertise. However, with the help of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, we can automate this process and generate informative and concise summaries.

**Purpose**\
The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how we can use the Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) model provided by the Huggingface Transformers library to generate summaries for academic papers. BART is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model that has achieved impressive results in various NLP tasks, including text summarization.

**What You'll Learn**\
By the end of this notebook, you'll learn how to:
- Use the Huggingface Transformers library to preprocess and tokenize text data for input into the BART model
- Fine-tune the BART model on the arXiv Summarization Dataset using the Seq2SeqTrainer class
- Evaluate the quality of the generated summaries using the ROUGE metric
- Generate summaries for academic papers using the fine-tuned BART model

**Getting Started**\
Before diving into the notebook, ensure you have the Huggingface Transformers library installed. You'll also need access to the arXiv Summarization Dataset.
