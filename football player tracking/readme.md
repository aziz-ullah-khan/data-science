# Football Player Tracking
---

Welcome to the Football Player Tracking notebook! In this project, we will focus on the task of player tracking in football matches. Football is one of the most popular sports in the world, and tracking player movements is crucial for analyzing player performance, team tactics, and generating data-driven insights for coaches and analysts.

To achieve our goal, we will be using the Sports Videos in the Wild dataset from the University of Michigan, which contains a large collection of football match videos. We will use the Ultralytics YOLOv5 algorithm, a state-of-the-art object detection and tracking model, to detect and track football players in these videos.

By the end of this project, we aim to have a functioning model that can accurately track players in football matches and provide insights into player performance and team dynamics. This project has the potential to contribute to the development of more advanced and sophisticated computer vision algorithms for sports analysis and beyond.

Whether you are a student, a data scientist, or a football enthusiast, we hope that you find this project informative, engaging, and fun!
