# Autoplay CartPole
---

Welcome to this repository where we will explore the use of reinforcement learning to play CartPole, an exciting and challenging game that requires balancing a pole on top of a cart. In this notebook, we will be using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is an effective approach for training agents in complex environments, to accomplish this task.

The Autoplay feature will enable us to observe the trained agent's performance in real-time as it learns to master the game of CartPole. We will be using the OpenAI gym CartPole dataset to create the game environment, and the Ray library will provide us with the necessary tools to build and train our agent.

By the end of this notebook, you will have a better understanding of reinforcement learning, how it can be applied to solve challenging problems such as CartPole, and how to use PPO to train agents in similar environments. Whether you are new to reinforcement learning or a seasoned expert, this repository is a great resource for learning and experimenting with these powerful techniques.

So let's dive in and see what we can achieve with reinforcement learning and CartPole!
